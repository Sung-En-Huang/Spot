# What it does ‚ùì
Spot is a housing market platform where tenants and landlords can match based on preference and compatibility. By incorporating the match system, tenants can breeze through housing applications curated towards their housing preferences while landlords get the luxury of a clear tenant application with no text fluff. The instantaneous matching feature and profile customization seeks to condense and simplify the rental process for tenants and landlords alike.

- Allows tenants and landlords to match based on their preferences
- Simplifies application process with profile and simple match system
- Reduces redundancy in application process, only one application is required from both sides

# How we built it üî®

- Amplify for user authentification
- DynamoDB stored client data
